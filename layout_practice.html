            <h1>Welcome to the layout practice page!</h1>
            <p>Here, we are practicing page layout. You'll notice there's a column to the left representing the navigation section, containing links to external webpages.
            The right side is just any generic message which I choose to generate. I guess I'm supposed to fill the rest of this up because we need content to show
            in order to get practice. So let's check out some random facts!</p>
            <li>Polar bear fur isn't white. It's actually clear and the reason it appears white is the reflection of its arctic environment.</li><br>
            <li>Contrary to popular belief, the deadliest cat in the world may not reside in Africa. The jaguar is said to have the strongest bite of all of the big cats.</li><br>
            <li>Mountain lions usually top out at around 140lbs. I'm not saying you could easily fight one, but if attacked by one you should be able to fight back and survive.</li><br>
            <li>Grizzly bears are found in Alaska, Canada, Montana, Idaho, Washington and Wyoming.</li><br>
            <li>Dolphins are the only other mammal that engage in sex for pleasure.</li>
